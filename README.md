## KEY FINDINGS

- 1. Customer Churn & Retention

A noticeable percentage of customers are churned, indicating retention issues.

Repeat customers represent a smaller portion, showing limited long-term engagement.

Churned customers often show low purchase frequency and long gaps between purchases.

- 2. Customer Segmentation & Loyalty

Most customers fall under low or mid-tier loyalty segments.

High-tier customers spend significantly more and purchase more frequently.

Loyalty program participation strongly correlates with increased revenue.

- 3. Purchase Behavior & Transaction Analysis

Average purchase frequency suggests customers buy infrequently, reducing lifetime value.

Promotion-driven transactions form a large share of total sales, highlighting dependency on discounts.

Non-promotion transactions remain steady but contribute less compared to promo periods.

- 4. Store & Channel Performance

Some store locations consistently outperform others in revenue and customer retention.

Online channels show stronger repeat purchase behavior compared to offline stores.

Store performance varies widely, signaling uneven customer experience across regions.

- 5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Majority of customers are in the low CLV segment.

High CLV customers show longer membership duration and stable purchase behavior.

“Days Since Last Purchase” helps predict churn risk with good accuracy.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- 1. Improve Customer Retention

Launch targeted win-back campaigns for customers with high "days since last purchase."

Personalize email offers based on churn signals and past product interests.

- 2. Strengthen Loyalty Program

Introduce better benefits for mid-tier customers to encourage movement to high-tier.

Provide exclusive rewards to high-tier customers to maintain loyalty and increase CLV.

- 3. Reduce Over-Reliance on Promotions

Shift from discount-heavy strategies to value-driven offers (bundles, early access).

Identify customer groups sensitive to discounts and design controlled promotions.

- 4. Optimize Store & Channel Performance

Improve staff training and in-store experience for low-performing locations.

Promote online channels for seamless repeat purchases and subscription-based programs.

- 5. Boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Create personalized product recommendations for high-value customers.

Implement a predictive churn model to intervene before customers stop purchasing.

## CONCLUSION

This Adidas analytics project reveals clear opportunities to enhance customer engagement, optimize loyalty programs, and improve store performance. While promotions drive significant sales, sustainable long-term growth depends on increasing customer loyalty, boosting CLV, and reducing churn. By leveraging data-driven strategies and targeted interventions, Adidas can build a more profitable, customer-centric business model with consistent repeat purchases and stronger customer relationships.
